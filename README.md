The Automated Bill Generator is a Python script designed to streamline the process of generating bills for purchases. The program prompts the user to input item details such as name, quantity, and price per item. It then calculates the total amount for each item and maintains a running total. Additionally, the program applies a 10% discount to the total amount and calculates an 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the pre-discounted total. The final bill is displayed, itemizing each purchase with its respective quantity, price, and total cost. The bill also includes the GST amount, discount applied, and the final payable amount. This automated process saves time and reduces errors in bill generation for businesses and individuals alike
